# Protocol routing — how /sniper-flow selects a protocol
routing:
  # File-count thresholds for auto-detection
  auto_detect:
    patch_max_files: 5       # <= 5 files changed → patch protocol
    feature_max_files: 20    # <= 20 files changed → feature protocol
    # > 20 files → full protocol

  # Default protocol when auto-detect is ambiguous
  default: feature

  # Protocol token budgets (override protocol defaults)
  budgets:
    full: 2000000
    feature: 800000
    patch: 200000
    ingest: 1000000

# Cost enforcement
cost:
  warn_threshold: 0.7       # Warn at 70% of budget
  soft_cap: 0.9              # Soft cap at 90% — agents must justify continuing
  hard_cap: 1.0              # Hard cap at 100% — stop execution

# Knowledge Manifest — domain knowledge sources for agent injection
# Place this file at .sniper/knowledge/manifest.yaml
# Agents consult this manifest to load relevant domain context before execution

# Each source entry declares a Markdown file containing domain expertise.
# During protocol execution, agents match their task context against topics
# and tags to selectively load only the knowledge they need.

sources:
  # topic:       Short identifier for the knowledge domain
  # file:        Path relative to .sniper/knowledge/
  # tokens:      Estimated token count (used for budget planning — measure with `wc -w file | awk '{print int($1 * 1.3)}'`)
  # tags:        Searchable labels for contextual matching (optional)
  # description: What this knowledge covers, so agents know when to load it (optional)

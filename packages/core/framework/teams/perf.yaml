# SNIPER Performance Audit Team
# Structured performance analysis
# ─────────────────────────────────────────

# Phase 1 (Profiling) is run by the lead directly as a single-agent phase.
# Unlike tests and security which use 2-agent teams, performance analysis
# is more sequential — the optimization plan depends on a coherent profiling
# analysis, so a single profiler keeps the analysis consistent.
#
# Phase 2 (Optimization Planning) is run by the lead directly.
# Phase 3 (Execution) uses the standard sprint infrastructure.
#
# This team YAML is used by /sniper-audit --target performance.

# SNIPER Refactor Team
# Structured large-scale code refactoring

# Note: Phase 1 (Impact Analysis) and Phase 2 (Migration Planning) are run by
# the lead directly as single-agent phases. Phase 3 (Execution) uses the
# standard sprint infrastructure with refactor stories.
#
# This team YAML is used for reference by the /sniper-audit --target refactor
# command to understand the team structure and review gate.

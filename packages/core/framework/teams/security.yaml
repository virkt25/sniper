# ─────────────────────────────────────────
# SNIPER Security Audit Team
# Structured security analysis
# ─────────────────────────────────────────

# Phase 1 (Analysis) spawns 2 agents in parallel:
#   - threat-modeler: maps attack surface and models threats via STRIDE
#   - vuln-scanner: finds application-level vulnerabilities via code analysis
#
# Phase 2 (Planning) is run by the lead to generate remediation stories.
# Phase 3 (Execution) uses the standard sprint infrastructure.
#
# This team YAML is used by /sniper-audit --target security.
